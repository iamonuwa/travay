# MetaMask

What is MetaMask?

MetaMask is the easiest way to interact with decentralized web applications in a browser. It is a browser extension that connects to an Ethereum network.

## Installing MetaMask

To install MetaMask for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=fr" target="_blank">FireFox</a>, go to the Firefox Add-ons page and click the Add to Firefox button.

Remember that MetaMask only works in FireFox on mobile devices.

## Setting up MetaMask

Click the MetaMask icon in your browser and this screen will appear:

Next, you'll receive 12 words. You must write them down before continuing.

You'll see the menu that shows "Main Network"

Remember that you need to be on the "Main Network" in order to process real transactions with real money and value. If you switch to any other network you will not be able to do real transactions.

You are now all set!

And this is what your transaction history page will look like:
